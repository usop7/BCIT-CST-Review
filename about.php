    <p class='list_title'>CST Review</p>
    <p>BCIT's Computer Systems Technology(CST) is an intensive two-year diploma program that combines computer systems theory with hands-on practical experience in software development. </p>
    <p>The purpose of CST Review is to allow students to share useful resources that can help each other to finish the program successfully. Your review and tips will be greatly appreciated and will help upcoming students to survive from CST!</p>
    <br>
    <p class='list_title'>A bit about me</p>
    <p>
      I am a CST student who started the program in January, 2018 and a former actuary who worked at financial firms in Korea.
    </p>

      I quickly learned how intense CST program is, and how much students want useful information to be prepared for a upcoming term in advance. Hope this website would be helpful to you.
